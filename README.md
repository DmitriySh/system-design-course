System Design Course
=======

`System Design` is the process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system that satisfies specific requirements. 
It requires a systematic approach to building and engineering systems. \
A good `system design` requires you to think about everything in an infrastructure, from the hardware and software, \
down to the data and how itâ€™s stored.
